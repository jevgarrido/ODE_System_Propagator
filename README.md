# Numerical Solver for Systems of Ordinary Differential Equations

This tool uses Runge-Kutta methods to solve ODE Systems - the specific method is user-selectable

So far, included methods are: Forward Euler, Explicit Midpoint, Runge-Kutta 4th Order, and Runge-Kutta 8th Order. All explicit.


# How to Use This Tool

0. (OPT) Create your own example containing a main function and a dynamics function;
1. Run "init.m" to set the paths;
2. Run using the command: "main('example_main')".

NOTE: The method to be used and the plotting options can be selected within each "example_main" function.

Enjoy :)
