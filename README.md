# Numerical Solver for Systems of Ordinary Differential Equations

This tool uses Runge-Kutta methods to solve ODE Systems - the specific method is user-selectable

So far, included methods are: Forward Euler, Explicit Midpoint, Runge-Kutta 4th Order, and Runge-Kutta 8th Order. All explicit.


# How to Use This Tool

0. (optional step) Create your own example problem containing a main function, a dynamics function and, in case you have it, the exact solution function;
1. Run "init.m" to set the paths;
2. Select the method to use (within each "example_main.m" file);
3. Run using the command: "main('example_main')".

Enjoy :)
