# To work on

+ Improve the ploting preferences set by the user in the main function - examples of preferences:
	. name and units of the states and of the independent variable.
	. position of labels.
	. title of plot/plots.
	
+ Implement simulation (when the states are coordinates)
	. Type A - default plotting (time in h-axis);
	. Type B - 2-D or 3-D coordinates, with time represented by color;
	. Type C - 2-D coordinates with time represented by 3rd dimension;
	
+ Regarding Type A plots:
	. Color should distinguish exact solution from mehtod(s);
	. Shapes should distinguish the specific states.
	

+ Add option to solve with various methods
	. choose to plot the solutions toguether for comparison or to plot them in separate figures.


+ Implement embeded methods for truncation error estimation and subsequent implementation of adaptive stepsize.
