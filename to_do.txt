# To work on

+ Improve the ploting preferences set by the user in the main function - examples of preferences:
	. name and units of the states and of the independent variable.
	. position of labels.
	. title of plot/plots.

+ Implement embeded methods for truncation error estimation and subsequent implementation of adaptive stepsize.

+ Implement Implicit methods (Multiple-step predictor-corrector).
	. predictor with Adams-Bashfoth and corrector with Adams-Moulton (order is user selectable);
	. First steps with Runge-Kutta 4th Order.
	
+ Implement Implicit methods (Single-step predictor-corrector).
	. predictor - corrector for the states - y(n+1);
	. predictor - corrector fot the derivarives - ki;
