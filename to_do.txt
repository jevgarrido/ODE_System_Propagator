# To work on

+ Improve the ploting preferences set by the user in the main function - examples of preferences:
	. name and units of the states and of the independent variable.
	. position of labels.
	. title of plot/plots.

+ Implement embeded methods for truncation error estimation and subsequent implementation of adaptive stepsize.

+ Add option to solve with various methods
	. choose to plot the solutions toguether for comparison or to plot them in separate figures.
	
+ Regarding Type A plots:
	. Specific states should be ploted separately (but in the same figure)
	. Shapes/ colors should distinguish methods within each ploting;
